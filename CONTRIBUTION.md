# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document describes a simple, consistent workflow for reporting issues and submitting changes.

## Get started
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main` (e.g., `feature/brief-description`).
- Keep changes focused and atomic.

## Reporting issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Provide a clear title, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment (OS, versions), and minimal repro if possible.
- Tag issues with labels when relevant (bug, enhancement, docs, question).

## Submitting pull requests
- Open a PR against the default branch with a descriptive title and summary.
- Link related issue(s) using “Fixes #NN” or “Closes #NN” to auto-close on merge.
- Keep PRs small and focused; include tests or screenshots where applicable.
- Wait for CI to pass and address requested changes from reviewers.

## Code style and quality
- Follow the project’s existing coding standards and linters/formatters.
- Add or update tests for new behavior.
- Include inline documentation/comments for complex logic.

## Commit messages
- Use clear, present-tense messages: "Add X", "Fix Y".
- Group related changes into a single commit where appropriate.

## Tests and CI
- Run the test suite locally before submitting a PR.
- Ensure CI checks pass (linting, tests, build).

## Documentation
- Update documentation or README for new features or breaking changes.
- Keep examples and usage instructions up to date.

## Security issues
- Do not post security vulnerabilities publicly. Contact maintainers privately (see repository SECURITY.md or maintainer contact).

## Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and collaborative. Follow the project’s Code of Conduct.

## Review process and merging
- Maintainers will review and request changes as needed.
- Do not merge your own PRs unless explicitly allowed.

## Licensing and attribution
- Ensure contributions comply with the repository license.
- Credit third-party code and resources appropriately.

If you’re unsure where to start, open an issue saying you want to contribute and maintainers will help you find a good first task.
